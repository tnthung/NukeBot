# NukeBot
Discord NukeBot is for deleting all channels and kicking 
all members of the Discord server. This is just a thing I
use to practice the `discord.js`, please don't take it 
seriously. I don't take the responsibilities to ANY damage
it made.


## Disclaimer
This bot is for FUN-ONLY.\
Everything it done is IRREVERSIBLE!\
DO NOT USE IT TO THE PUBLIC SERVER!!!!!!


## Setup
### Step 0:
Make sure you have `Node.JS` & `NPM` on your machine.

### Step 1:
Create you own bot and get the token of the bot.\
You can find plenty of tutorials online.
  
### Step 2:
In `index.js` file, find:
```js
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    await client.login("PUT UR TOKEN RIGHT HERE");
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
```
and replace the `PUT UR TOKEN RIGHT HERE` with the token you got from step 1.

### Step 3:
Invite it the the target server.

> You may found out it leaves the channel right away,
> that's because the checkbox of admin permission has been unchecked.

### Step 4:
Open the terminal and cd into the folder, then run
`npm i && npm start`

### Step 5:
`"The Most Creative Server Name": 12233344445555666`\
Copy the ID following the correct server name and enter it.

### Step 6:
> ⚠️ Once you fired, the bot will try to delete all channels and kick all members.\
> The second confirmation means you've acknowledged the consequences.

Type in `y` if you sure you want to do this.

### Step 7:
Sit back & Watch the show.
